## Xiao He
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geographic Information Science at Central South University. My research lies at the intersection of GeoAI, Complexity Science, and Urban Computing.
Moving beyond static descriptions of urban forms, I am passionate about decoding the generative mechanisms of spatial synergy. My work explores how macroscopic urban structures (e.g., polycentricity) emerge from microscopic human mobility and agent-based interactions.
Technically, I specialize in bridging probabilistic modeling (e.g., Fuzzy Theory) with Network (e.g., Hypergraph) to solve complex geospatial problems.
Feel free to check my [Publications](/publications/) for my latest work on fuzzy community detection, or explore my [Blogs](/tags/Blogs/) for technical insights.
