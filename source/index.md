## Xiao He

I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in **Urban Computing** and **Complex Network Analysis**. My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of human mobility and the structure of urban spatial networks.

I am passionate about applying **Fuzzy Theory** and **Hypergraph Learning** to solve real-world problems in urban planning and transportation. My recent work involves developing novel community detection methods that respect the semantic integrity of urban regions.
